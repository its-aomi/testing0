I&#8217;m a white guy. I like dancing, but I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I am truly awful at it. I have no idea when to jump, or shuffle, or just fist pump when the beat drops.<\/p>\n<p>This fear of not knowing &#8216;what to do with my hands&#8217; and body would eventually begin to grow. I became so self-conscious, that instead of rocking out front row, I would stay home. \u00a0I thought I could fix the problem myself, so I put on headphones and stood in front of the bathroom mirror and tried to make it look like I was in the <strong>Tomorrowland\u00a0<\/strong>after movie. This sadly didn&#8217;t work and only worsened my problem, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#8217;t nail the slow-mo euphoria. Eventually, the idea of a going to a show would cause me so much conflicted anxiety that I ended up crying naked on my bedroom floor in utter hopeless despair.<\/p>\n<p>I looked into support groups, there were none. I tried\u00a0counseling but, apparently EDM related dance anxiety isn&#8217;t an actual disorder, but as I learned it is something that doctors will laugh at.\u00a0Having hit a dead end in my dancing career, I began to explore other options, like maybe joining a monastery or becoming an accountant. Anything to get me away from the pressure of how to control my body at shows<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youredm.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/I-Dont-Know-What-To-Do-With-My-Hands-Your-EDM.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27329\" alt=\"I-Dont-Know-What-To-Do-With-My-Hands-Your-EDM\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youredm.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/I-Dont-Know-What-To-Do-With-My-Hands-Your-EDM.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>One of life&#8217;s deepest questions&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Then one day everything changed. I\u00a0received an email from none other than hypemaster\u00a0<strong>MC Rycky Flash<\/strong>\u00a0(apparently pronounced Ricky). Who said he could completely cure me of my ineptitude and all it would take is one day of immersive experiences with a master of the microphone. Tears of joy streaming down my face, I picked up the phone and made a call that would change my life forever.\u00a0<strong>Rycky<\/strong>,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>told me to meet him in downton Denver, Colorado right in the very heart of the city, early that next day&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Below, I will chronicle my\u00a0life-changing\u00a0experience and transformation into an ascended god of the\u00a0dance floor who understands the true importance of MC&#8217;s at shows.<\/p>\n<p>My nerves were a raging torrent of pure chemical fear as I pressed the call button on the elevator that would deliver me to my fate. With an ominous ding, the elevator doors slid open and I stepped in. Pressing the top floor button, the elevator lept upwards to the highest reaches of the building. The entire ride I did all in my power to keep from violently vomiting my meager breakfast onto my fresh new kicks, which I had bought with the explicit purpose of looking &#8216;fresh on the floor&#8217;; a purpose yet unfulfilled. As I neared my destination, I began to notice a subtle yet unmistakable four on the floor kick drum that\u00a0intensely\u00a0loudened as I was lifted higher and higher. The elevator jolted to a sudden halt, the doors slid open and revealed a hallway leading down to a single door. The bass had become deafening at this point, although it was nearly muffled by my own pounding heartbeat. With great\u00a0trepidation, I shuffled to the door and knocked. To my surprise the door swung open as if it was guided by the hand of the spirit of dance music itself.<\/p>\n<p>Standing with his back to the door stood a figure who I assumed to be\u00a0<strong>Rycky Flash<\/strong>, staring down on Denver through an enormous plate glass window.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; he asked without turning to me.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Ready&#8230;? for what?&#8221; I responded, unable to stop my voice from shaking.<\/p>\n<p>He paused for a moment which seemed like an eternity. &#8220;To put your f*cking hands up,&#8221; he replied with a sudden power in his voice.<\/p>\n<p>I nodded, forgetting he couldn&#8217;t see me.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Step inside, we start right now, can you FEEL it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t feel anything, nevertheless I stepped into his penthouse\u00a0immediately\u00a0regretting my decision, thinking to myself &#8220;God, let me be a CPA, I swear I&#8217;ll never listen to EDM again if you just get me out of here,&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Besides the designer furniture and luxury white carpets my attention was\u00a0immediately\u00a0drawn to a large glass tank filled with water, illuminated by flashing strobes of brilliant color. I could vaguely make out a\u00a0silhouette\u00a0of a creature that had too many\u00a0appendages\u00a0to count all of which were raised in the water.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you like my friend?&#8221;\u00a0<strong>Rycky\u00a0<\/strong>asked, turning around dramatically, &#8220;Flash Junior, is a marvelous creature isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Before I could respond I noticed that\u00a0<strong>Rycky<\/strong>\u00a0whose eyes concealed behind <strong>Rayban\u00a0<\/strong><b>Wayfarers <\/b>and\u00a0dressed in a Native America print bro tank and jeans skinnier than I thought possible, was holding a microphone. I began to open my mouth to speak but\u00a0before I could choke any words out,\u00a0<strong>Rycky<\/strong> raised the microphone to his mouth, raising one fist in the air. As if on cue, the blaring loud music began to build,\u00a0&#8220;Denver!!!! Get those hands up!!!&#8221; he bellowed.<\/p>\n<p>The lights in the tank exploded revealing Flash Junior to be a blood red octopus. Heeding the command the octopus raised all eight tentacles straight up and began to wave them wildly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When this drops I want to see you jump! MAKE SOME NOOOISEE&#8221;\u00a0<strong>Rycky\u00a0<\/strong>yelled again, into the microphone beginning to bounce to the beat.<\/p>\n<p>Just as he commanded, Junior let out a stream of bubbles which I can only assume came from a joyous\u00a0aquatic\u00a0shout. The music reached a fever pitch and then slammed into the drop. The creature began to fly up and down to the beat in his watery environment, changing every imaginable neon color. It was a sight of pure beauty that melted my fear and doubts in an instant. I wanted to be an octopus in that moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rycky Flash<\/strong> shot me a winning grin and dropped the mic, placing his freed hand on my shoulder.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;I can make you even better, I will connect you to the animal inside of you that must be tamed. I will free you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In total awe of the spectacle in front of me, I was unable to speak. The MC raised his hand and snapped his finger. The music instantly cut as if responding to the will of this wise sensei.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; he asked again.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I decreed, with a new found resolve in my voice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Good, then let&#8217;s go,&#8221; he said guiding me out of the door back into the hallway, shutting it with a heavy thud.<\/p>\n<p>My journey had begun, stay tuned for part 2.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>End of part 1&#8230; Stay tuned for part two on Saturday!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/brettedgerly\">@BrettEdgerly<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: The following article may or may not be an entire work of fiction.
